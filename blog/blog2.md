# My Journey to NYC - 06/27/2025

As my most recent experience, I think I'll begin here. How did I get here?

## Background

Alrighty, so to give some background, this is my first internship. In the current state of Computer Science, it is hard to land a role. I was fortunate enough to have had research opportunities with one of my professors. If it weren't for that, I wouldn't be here. New York Life was pretty quick in their interview process and decision to accept me, and for that, I am grateful. I am grateful for everything that has come upon me in the past two years that have been able to turn my educational career a full 180.

## Why Computer Science?

So, why did I choose Computer Science? I grew up poor, so I went a decent amount of my life without any technology other than CRT TVs with free cable. Eventually, I was eventually able to have video games like the Gamecube, Wii, and PS2 like any other child. By that time however, they've moved on to the Next generation of consoles. The first time I was able to get something on time was when the 3DS came out. I begged my father for one, and he was able to make it work. I was never great at video games, but I was definetly attached to them, and it is what sparked my interest in technology. 

How were people able to make these small devices that display all these things that you can interact with? I also grew up in the era that slowly introduced technology for learning, like the iPods. It was all fascinating to me, and at this point, I knew working with technology is what I wanted to do. I just didn't know how.

In high school, there's things like AVID, but the school also has workshops and what not to prepare us for college. Sure, we can take a year off. But for people like me, I hate the feeling of falling behind. I just find it crazy that before we are adults, we are already deciding one of the more important decisions of our lives: our major. Okay, so I like computers. I took a graphic design class and I thought it was cool. Hmm, only the community college offers a program related to that. Associates? what's a bachelors? I'll just choose the program that inolves computers - graphic design.

And that was it. the decision that would affect my future made. Luckily for me, at the same time, my high school began offering AP Computer Science. Taught by one of my favorite math teachers. One that was able to turn my math grades from C's to A's. I enjoyed her style of teaching, and I like technology, so it was a no brainer that I'd decided to enroll. From the beginning, I fell in love with the course. We were working on code.org assignments, and almost everybody was not interested. I liked it so much that I even did it at home. The website had a leaderboard, and I was at the top. Miles ahead of everyone. My teacher told the class that this was an exciting field and that we should consider it for college. If so, she'd write our names on the board if we get accepted. I instantly knew that I had to change my major from there, and that's where it began.
