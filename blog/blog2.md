# My Journey to NYC - 06/27/2025

As my most recent experience, I think I'll begin here. How did I get here?

## Background

Alrighty, so to give some background, this is my first internship. In the current state of Computer Science, it is hard to land a role. I was fortunate enough to have had research opportunities with one of my professors. If it weren't for that, I wouldn't be here. New York Life was pretty quick in their interview process and decision to accept me, and for that, I am grateful. I am grateful for everything that has come upon me in the past two years that have been able to turn my educational career a full 180.

## Why Computer Science?

So, why did I choose Computer Science? I grew up poor, so I went a decent amount of my life without any technology other than CRT TVs with free cable. Eventually, I was eventually able to have video games like the Gamecube, Wii, and PS2 like any other child. By that time however, they've moved on to the Next generation of consoles. The first time I was able to get something on time was when the 3DS came out. I begged my father for one, and he was able to make it work. I was never great at video games, but I was definetly attached to them, and it is what sparked my interest in technology. 

How were people able to make these small devices that display all these things that you can interact with? I also grew up in the era that slowly introduced technology for learning, like the iPods. It was all fascinating to me, and at this point, I knew working with technology is what I wanted to do. I just didn't know how.

In high school, there's things like AVID, but the school also has workshops and what not to prepare us for college. Sure, we can take a year off. But for people like me, I hate the feeling of falling behind. I just find it crazy that before we are adults, we are already deciding one of the more important decisions of our lives: our major. Okay, so I like computers. I took a graphic design class and I thought it was cool. Hmm, only the community college offers a program related to that. Associates? what's a bachelors? I'll just choose the program that inolves computers - graphic design.

And that was it. the decision that would affect my future made. Luckily for me, at the same time, my high school began offering AP Computer Science. Taught by one of my favorite math teachers. One that was able to turn my math grades from C's to A's. I enjoyed her style of teaching, and I like technology, so it was a no brainer that I'd decided to enroll. From the beginning, I fell in love with the course. We were working on code.org assignments, and almost everybody was not interested. I liked it so much that I even did it at home. The website had a leaderboard, and I was at the top. Miles ahead of everyone. My teacher told the class that this was an exciting field and that we should consider it for college. If so, she'd write our names on the board if we get accepted. I instantly knew that I had to change my major from there, and that's where it began. 
 
## Realization

During most of my time during college, I was a C student in every aspect. I only received As in Computer Science classes as I still enjoyed them, and most math classes since those were in between me liking the technical/logial portions, but despising mathematical proofs, theory, etc. I never really thought about my future, and for that, I didn't try hard enough to better myself. I thought since I was getting As for the classes that matter to me, I'll be alright. I was wrong, and I didn't realize until the end of my third year. 

Just when I thought it was that time again to relax during the summer, I started hearing all these word. Internships, experience, resume. I frantically searched up these terms only to find out I had been wasting my time. Quickly, I created a resume that showcased my barebones course projects, 3.2 GPA, and Chipotle Grill Cook experience. I started mass applying to internships, realizing that people who had far better resumes than I were also having trouble. This is when I found out how serious it was. 

My first bit of luck came when I received interviews for Amazon as a SDE. I passed the OA (Not very good though, I believe they passed me due to my comments explaining my thought process), and the personality assesment. After that came the live interview. This was my first exposure toward Leetcode style interviews. I was asked a BST question, and I had failed miserably. Right after bombing the interview, I searched for that question online, only to find it labeled as 'Easy.' After that I tried to study Leetcode-styled problems, but it was only failed OA after failed OA. In the end, I didn't find anything and was truly humbled. I felt behind which I hated. So I decided to change things.

I decided that I would retake classes during the summer, and when I return. I would do my best for all coursed that I recevied a C- or lower in, because those were able to be repaired to fix my GPA. I would also try my best for any future classes. I did just that once school started, but this time, I was hungry for opportunities. My second bit of luck was when the LAEP program as a thing. As an economically disadvantaged minority, this program was made for people in situations like me to create access for learing-allined research employment. I applied to one that was assigned to a professor I had during that semester. It was mid semester, so she recognized me and intervewed me. Being a computer science course, I continued to get As and she accepted me because of that. Later on, she also asked me to be her grader for the second semester.

This was the hardest part of my journey. During my last semster, I was grading, researching, working as a server at a retirement home with 12-hour shifts on sundays, and helping my father with construction on saturdays. Despite juggling all these responsibilites, I managed to come out on top. I finished my grading. With the help of funding opportunities, I traveled to Hawaii for a week with my sisters where I preseneted and published my first paper. I continued my server job, and continued to help my father which only fueled my motivation since I felt the need to retire my parents for the opportunities that they had given me.

Around this time near graduation, my professor was impressed with my research and encouraged me to apply for the masters program, and to the "Summer Scholars" program which is also a resarch-oriented opportunity. Being desparate for opportunities, I accepted and applied. I was accepted, and my summer was secured. This time around, we dived into smart contract optimization as well as analysing Sui and Aptos objects. I tried my best, and with that, we were able to squeeze out 3 published papers. All of this has led to my resume being half-decent, so when the time came to return to school, I wasted no time. I applied for everything. 

One day, New York Life sent me an automated invitiation to apply on Handshakem so I instantly did. I quickly recived a call which was a behavioral phone interview. I knew I had to stand out, so I researched the company, their linkedin, and previous interns so that I had a lot to speak on the company and to have questions for the internship. That seemed to work, since I moved onto a video interview with a software engineer where we talked about my blockchain research expereice. He then asked me a simple question: Create a function that tells you if a string is a palindrome. Once I heard this, I was relieved. A company that doesn't ask an "Easy" leetcde question. I ended up passing that and sometime later during school, I recieved the call. An offer that I had instantly accepted then and there. I made sure to ask if they offer relocation assistance since I had little monet to whcih they said they offered a stipend in advance. For that, I was able to find a place in Jersey City, close to Manhattan.

## Moving is hard

In between the time from the acceptance, to a few days prior to my flight, I felt nothing. No worries, no anxiety. I thought I was tough and that I'd just be in and out. It was another thing I was going to all out in. But when the day came, I felt sick in the stomach. The realization had settled in. I'm leaving, and I'm going to be alone for two and a half months.

## Self Battle

(internship, alone, am i enough)
